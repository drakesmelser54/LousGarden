        <h4>Meet the Smelser Family</h4>
        <p>Olivia, and Eloise are three St. Louisians with a knack for gardening. Before Eloise entered the world, Drake and Olivia set out to create a garden for their daughter. They spent hours learning about carpentry, St. Louis horticulture, and how to transform an urban patch of land into an agricultural sanctuary.<br><br>Two years into their mission, the Smelsers are tending to Lou's Garden. Each season, the trio experiments with their garden, making new additions to their crops and ammendments to their soil.<br><br>Most of all, they are growing their family.</p>

        <h4>Why Garden?</h4>
        <p>Gardening benifits the Gardener, and his/her community, plain and simple. Once you start harvesting your household's fruits and veggies from your backyard instead of the grocery store, you'll start saving money pretty quickly. A study by the National Gardening Association details that the average gardener's $70 investment provides "an estimated 300 pounds of fresh produce worth $600."<br><br>In addition, home grown fruits and veggies allow the consumer to control what soil, fertilizer, and other foreign substances are in their vegitation. This is a sigh or relief in an era of preservative filled produce.<br><br>Tending to a garden is also body positive. It can reduce stress, promote healthy levels of excercise, and increase Vitamin-D intake.<br><br>Erecting and maintaing a garden can also increase curbside appeal, adding monetary value to your community. But who cares about money? Communites containing gardens have proven that they have increased overall happieness of their members. In a study conducted by Princeton University, researchers found that "household gardens could be key to providing food security in urban areas and making cities more sustainable and livable." <br><br>The real question is,<br><br>Why wouldn't you garden?</p>

        <h4>St. Louis</h4>
        <p>St. Louis is a melting pot of cultures and a hotbed for gardens! It's no suprise that the home of the Missouri Botanical Garden's contains some of the most suitable soil and climate features for home-gardening. With long seasons for both cool and warm plants, prospective growers can choose from a variety of different plant species. There's no strict script to follow in your garden.<br><br>Above the soil, you'll find an urban landscape; depending on where you are, you might even see the Arch! Yet, somehow St. Louis has merged this sprawl with successful community gardens. Just visit Virgina Orchard, Urban Harvest, or Gateway Greening to see this in action.<br><br>These community gardens and countless others have inspired St. Louisians to take to the shovel and create their own gardens. Hopefully you can join them!</p>
